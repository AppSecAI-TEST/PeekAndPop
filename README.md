# PeekAndPop

THIS LIBRARY IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND NOT INTENDED TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION

PeekAndPop is an open source Android library, inspired by Instagram's latest 3D touch feature.
As 3D touch is not available for android, this library uses long hold.

Peek and pop allows you to long click on a view to "peek" and see a larger view in the centre of the screen.
To "pop" you can drag the view to the top of the screen and release.

Features:
- Create a basic peek and pop that shows on long click and is dismissed on touch up.
- Fling to action, where flinging the view to the top while trigger an action.
- Add an extra view to be shown above the view that animates out when flung (can be used to help show users what to do.)
- Specify extra views that can listen to long hold events (if the user holds the view for a 
certain amount of time).
