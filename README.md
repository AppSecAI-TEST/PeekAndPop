# PeekAndPop

THIS LIBRARY IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND NOT INTENDED TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION

PeekAndPop is an open source Android library, inspired by Instagram's latest 3D touch feature.

Peek and pop allows you to long click on a view to "peek" and see a larger view in the centre of the screen.

Features:
- Create a basic peek and pop that shows on long click and is dismissed on touch up.
- Enable drag to action, allowing the view to be dragged up to trigger an event on touch up.
- Add an extra view to be animated in when the peek is dragged up.
- TO BE IMPLEMENTED - Specify extra views that can listen to delayed touch events (if the user touches
the view for a certain amount of time).
