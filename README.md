# PeekAndPop

THIS LIBRARY IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND NOT INTENDED TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION

PeekAndPop is an open source Android library, inspired by Instagram's latest 3D touch feature.
As 3D touch has yet to come android, this library uses long hold.

Peek and pop allows you to long click on a view to "peek" and see a larger view in the centre of the screen.
To "pop" you can drag the view to the top of the screen and release.

Features:
- Create a basic peek and pop that shows on long click and is dismissed on touch up.
- Enable drag to action, allowing the view to be dragged up to trigger an event on touch up.
- Add an extra view to be animated in when the peek is dragged up.
- Specify extra views that can listen to long hold events (if the user holds the view for a 
certain amount of time).
