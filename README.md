# PeekAndPop

THIS LIBRARY IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND NOT INTENDED TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION

PeekAndPop is an open source Android library, inspired by Instagram's latest 3D touch feature.
As 3D touch is not available for android, this library uses long hold.

Peek and pop allows you to long click on a view to "peek" and see a larger view in the centre of the screen.
The pop feature can be imitated using fling to action gestures or from a hold and release event.

Features:
- Create a basic peek and pop that shows on long click and is dismissed on touch up.
- Fling to action, where flinging the view upwards or downwards (sidewards in landscape) triggers an event.
- Specify views within the peek view layout that can listen to long hold events (if the user holds the view for a 
certain amount of time).
- Specify views within the peek view layout that can listen to hold and release events (where the user holds the view
 and then releases).

Please check the examples below to see the features in action (to be added):
